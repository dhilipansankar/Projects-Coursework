Implement basic ICP using pipes

Implement a program to read write 2 messages using parent & child process


The mesages in question

echo "Pune" >> new.txt
echo "Mumbai" >> new.txt


cat newtext | grep


Although pipe can be accessed like an ordinary file, the system actually manages it as FIFO queue. A pipe file is created using the pipe system call
A pipe descriptor, has an array that stores two pointers, one for input and one for output



Message queues is another approach to IPC's.
